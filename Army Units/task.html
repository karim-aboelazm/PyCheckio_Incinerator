<h2>Army Units</h2>
<p>
 You are the developer of the new strategy game and you need to add the soldier creation process to it. Let's start with the 2 types - AsianArmy and EuropeanArmy (each of them will be a subclass of the Army - class with the methods for the creation of soldiers). Also there will be 3 types of soldiers in the game - Swordsman, Lancer, and Archer (also the classes). Each army has unique names for those 3 types. For the EuropeanArmy there are: Knight (for Swordsman), Raubritter (for Lancer), and Ranger (for Archer). For the AsianArmy: Samurai (for Swordsman), Ronin (for Lancer), and Shinobi (for Archer).
 <br/>
 Each army can create all 3 types of the soldiers using the next methods:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>
  train_swordsman
 </strong>
 (name) - create an instance of the Swordsman.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  train_lancer
 </strong>
 (name) - create an instance of the Lancer.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  train_archer
 </strong>
 (name) - create an instance of the Archer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All 3 classes (Swordsman, Lancer, and Archer) should have the
 <strong>
  introduce()
 </strong>
 method, which returns the string that describes the soldiers in the following format:
 <br/>
 "'type' 'name', 'army type' 'specialization(basic class)'", for example:
 <br/>
 "Raubritter Harold, European lancer"
 <br/>
 "Shinobi Kirigae, Asian archer"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In this mission you should use the

  Abstract Factory
 </a>
 design pattern.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example
 </strong>
 :
 <pre class="brush: python">
my_army = EuropeanArmy()
enemy_army = AsianArmy()

soldier_1 = my_army.train_swordsman("Jaks")
soldier_2 = my_army.train_lancer("Harold")
soldier_3 = my_army.train_archer("Robin")

soldier_4 = enemy_army.train_swordsman("Kishimoto")
soldier_5 = enemy_army.train_lancer("Ayabusa")
soldier_6 = enemy_army.train_archer("Kirigae")

soldier_1.introduce() == "Knight Jaks, European swordsman"
soldier_2.introduce() == "Raubritter Harold, European lancer"
soldier_3.introduce() == "Ranger Robin, European archer"
    
soldier_4.introduce() == "Samurai Kishimoto, Asian swordsman"
soldier_5.introduce() == "Ronin Ayabusa, Asian lancer"
soldier_6.introduce() == "Shinobi Kirigae, Asian archer"
</pre>
