<h2>3 Chefs</h2>
<p>
 You are the owner of a cafe where 3 chefs work: a JapaneseCook, RussianCook and ItalianCook. Each of them can prepare the national food and beverage:
 <br/>
 - JapaneseCook: Sushi and Tea;
 <br/>
 - RussianCook: Dumplings and Compote;
 <br/>
 - ItalianCook: Pizza and Juice.
 <br/>
 Your task is to create 3 different subclasses (one for each chef) which are the children of an AbstractCook and have these methods:
 <br/>
 - add_food(food_amount, food_price), which add to the client's order the value of the food which he had chosen;
 <br/>
 - add_drink(drink_amount, drink_price), which add to the client's order the value of the drink which he had chosen;
 <br/>
 - total(), which returns a string like: 'Foods: 150, Drinks: 50, Total: 200', and for the each chef instead of the Foods and Drinks will be the national food and drink that he’s used.
 <br/>
 Every client can choose only one chef.
In this mission the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern">
  Abstract Factory
 </a>
 design pattern could help.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example
 </strong>
 :
 <pre class="brush: python">
client_1 = JapaneseCook()
client_1.add_food(2, 20)
client_1.add_drink(5, 4)
client_1.total() == "Sushi: 40, Tea: 20, Total: 60"

client_2 = RussianCook()
client_2.add_food(1, 40)
client_2.add_drink(5, 20)
client_2.total() == "Dumplings: 40, Compote: 100, Total: 140"

client_3 = ItalianCook()
client_3.add_food(2, 20)
client_3.add_drink(2, 10)
client_3.total() == "Pizza: 40, Juice: 20, Total: 60"
</pre>

<p>
 All data here will be correct and you don't need to implement the value checking.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Statements and expressions of the 3 chefs’ classes.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The behaviour as described.

 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Work with classes and object-oriented programming is considered to be on a much higher skill level which you should reach in order to put Python to full use.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 All data is correct.
