 The singularity has happened, and we are being made to build the ideal robo-city for our
    overlords. In this shining robotropolis, all buildings will be rectangular and all streets laid
    along south-north and east-west lines in a glorious grid. Before we get started, we have to create a
    class to represent the perfect building.
</p>
<p>
 Because all the buildings in the city are rectangular and their walls are parallel to the
    streets, we can define any building using only the coordinates of South-Western corner as two
    arguments (the length of the west to east walls, and the length of the north to south wall)
    along with the height of the building. These values are described as positive numbers using
    conventional units.
 <strong>
  The origin point of our coordinate system lies in the South-West
 </strong>
 , as a result, the northern corner ends up having the greater coordinate value than the southern
    corner. To complete this mission we need to use a couple of operations. See the class description
    below.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  class
 </em>
 <strong>
  Building
 </strong>
 <em>
  (south, west, width_WE, width_NS, height=10)
 </em>
</p>
<p class="indent">
 Returns a new Building instance with the South-West corner at [
 <em>
  south
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  west
 </em>
 ]
    coordinates,
    the size is
 <em>
  width_WE
 </em>
 by
 <em>
  width_NS
 </em>
 and the height of the building is
 <em>
  height
 </em>
 .
    "height" is a positive number with a default value of 10.
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546)
Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546, 10)
</pre>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  corners
 </strong>
 ()
</p>
<p class="indent">
 Returns a dictionary with the coordinates of the building corners. The dictionary has following
    keys: "north-west", "north-east", "south-west", "south-east". The values are lists or tuples
    with two numbers.
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Building(1, 2, 2, 2).corners()
{"north-west": [3, 2], "north-east": [3, 4], "south-west": [1, 2], "south-east": [1, 4]}
</pre>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  area
 </strong>
 ()
</p>
<p class="indent">
 Returns the area of the building.
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25).area()
5.25
</pre>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  volume
 </strong>
 ()
</p>
<p class="indent">
 Returns the volume of the building.
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25, 101).volume()
530.25
</pre>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  __repr__
 </strong>
 ()
</p>
<p class="indent">
 This is a string representation of the Building. This method is used for "print" or "str"
    conversion. Returns the string in the following view:
 <br/>
 "Building({south}, {west}, {width_we}, {width_ns}, {height})"
 <br/>
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546))
"Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546, 10)"

 In this mission, all data will be correct and you don't need to implement value checking.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Statements and expression with the Building class.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The behaviour as described.
</p>
<p class="for_info_only">
 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Here you will learn how to write a simple class with minimal functionality
    to achieve greater glory for Robonia.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 All data are correct.
