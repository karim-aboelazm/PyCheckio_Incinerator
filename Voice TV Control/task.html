<h2>Voice TV Control</h2>
<p>
 The technologies are rapidly evolving - only 50 years ago a simple black-and-white TV was a luxury! And now even a cool big color TV with remote control is a common thing. Let's try to improve our TV and add the voice control to it! To begin with, we’ll write the simple prototype in Python. It’ll use the following commands:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>
  first_channel()
 </strong>
 - turns on the first channel from the list.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  last_channel()
 </strong>
 - turns on the last channel from the list.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  turn_channel(N)
 </strong>
 - turns on the N channel. Pay attention that the channel numbers start from 1, not from 0.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  next_channel()
 </strong>
 - turns on the next channel. If the current channel is the last one, turns on the first channel.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  previous_channel()
 </strong>
 - turns on the previous channel. If the current channel is the first one, turns on the last channel.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  current_channel()
 </strong>
 - returns the name of the current channel.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  is_exist(N/'name')
 </strong>
 - gets 1 argument - the number N or the string 'name' and returns "Yes", if the channel N or 'name' exists in the list, or "No" - in the other case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The default channel turned on before all commands is №1.
 <br/>
 Your task is to create the VoiceCommand class and methods described above.
 <br/>
 In this mission you could use the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern">
  Iterator
 </a>
 design pattern.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example
 </strong>
 :
 <pre class="brush: python">
CHANNELS = ["BBC", "Discovery", "TV1000"]

controller = VoiceCommand(CHANNELS)

controller.first_channel() == "BBC"
controller.last_channel() == "TV1000"
controller.turn_channel(1) == "BBC"
controller.next_channel() == "Discovery"
controller.previous_channel() == "BBC"
controller.current_channel() == "BBC"
controller.is_exist(4) == "No"
controller.is_exist("BBC") == "Yes"
</pre>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 The voice commands.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The channel name or result of the is_exist method.
</p>
<p class="for_info_only">
 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 For work with the iterable objects.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 All commands and channel names are correct.
</p>
